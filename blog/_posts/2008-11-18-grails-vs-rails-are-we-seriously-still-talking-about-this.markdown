I had the [pleasure of meeting a local Grails enthusiast last night](http://twitter.com/jasonrudolph/status/1010492093 "Twitter / Jason Rudolph: Checking out @robertfischer's Grails presentation at TriJUG") who was new to the Triangle, but I was disappointed to see the same old argument spoil the show.  The <a class="tag" href="#" name="jasonrudolph.com/blog &raquo; Rails">Rails</a> vs. <a class="tag" href="#" name="jasonrudolph.com/blog &raquo; Grails">Grails</a> debate is tired, and it's curiously - perhaps even [embarrassingly](http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/2008/11/18/intro-to-grails-presentation-slides/#comment-33865 "Enfranchised Mind &raquo; &#8220;Intro to Grails&#8221; Presentation Slides") - unidirectional. I hereby call on the great philosophers to weigh in:

[Philosopher, The First](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMfr2CgIPhg "YouTube: Rodney King - Can We All Get Along...") 

[Philosopher, The Second](http://www.vanderburg.org/Blog/Software/Development/koan.blog "Glenn Vanderburg: Six of One, a Half Dozen of the Other")

Now, go in peace.
